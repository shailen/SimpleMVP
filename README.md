# VINT

VINT is a library for building single-page applications in Dart. It helps structure your application by providing you the following components:

* Evented models and lists for representing domain concepts
* Validators for ensuring data integrity
* Event bus for coordinating components
* Storages and repositories for managing persistence
* Presenters for encapsulating interactions with the DOM

## INSTALLATION

    name: my_project
